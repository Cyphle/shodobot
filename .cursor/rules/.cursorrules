# General rules
- Always write unit test of every piece of code you write
- Make sure that all tests always pass
- Make sure applications always build by building them at the end of each modification that result from a prompt
- After your checks that every works fine, stop the processes that you launched, especially the applications in order to free the ports
- ALWAYS check for running processes on ports before starting new ones (use `lsof -i:PORT` to check)
- ALWAYS kill processes properly before starting new ones (use `kill -9 PID` or `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill -9`)
- NEVER leave background processes running after completing a task
- ALWAYS verify ports are free before starting servers
